# Voltage-regulator
 Arduino Volt Regulator
  
  We normally use batteries to power our arduino projects but the problem
  you would have had is that a 9volt battery runs for hardly 1 week
  (depends on the usage)and you have to buy more and more for testing
  purpose and the finished project...by buying more batteries you will
  waste your money and get E-Waste after using them as they can't be
  recharged.If you go with rechargable batteries then you gotta charge 
  them often as they run out of charge pretty quickly.What I have done 
  is a voltage regulator which you can resist the voltage of output 
  from 0v to 5v.This project has a display which shows the current 
  voltage which is outputted by a graph.

  I hope you will learn something by building this project and never have to waste money on non rechargeable batteries.

  This is a fully functional and Volt Regulator and frquency generator that you can make.
